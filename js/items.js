            'The victim was a small merchant from London, originally born in Ireland. Recently, Jones came across a large inheritance from a deceased uncle in France, estimated to be worth around 1.500.000 pounds sterling.\n' +
            'Immediately afterwards, Jones bought a manor near the Westminster Abode, and has been living there since. According to family members, Jones was a loner, and was never married, nor had children. He had a taste for drinking and boasting his achievements, and was someone who could get in fights easily.\n'  +

            'Notes:\n' +
            'According to Mrs Sheldon\'s account, Jones was already desperately running away before he was killed. Maybe he already knew he was going to be killed, however, Mrs Sheldon didn\'t see anyone else enter the street. Who was he running away from ?\n' +
            'Mr North, the victim\'s cousin, came to the country in order to investigate how his father\'s inheritance came into the hands of a relative he didn\'t have a close relationship with. As much as stealing money could have been a motivation, Mr North believes that Jones\' coarse ways annoyed the wrong people.\n' + 
            'Ms Jones\' account was a goldmine. Mr Jones was in a business venture with a mysterious man. He became paranoid and started frequenting the Saint Paul abode in Westminster, shortly before his death. I must investigate this church myself.\n',
